        "desc": " When the effects of a hypnosis-inducing drug fade, April slowly begins a conscious awakening. Memories of her past are unclear, and she has no recollection of her identity or whereabouts. As the days slip by, April realizes there is more to life than existing when she is introduced to an occupant who does just that - her sister. The more she learns about her environment, the more she wants to escape. But can April remember her past, and her sister? Will she have the courage to leave - and if she does, where can she go? A riveting story of suspense set in a post-apocalyptic world, 'Playing In The Rain' is the first book in Sandra J. Jackson's Escape Series.",
