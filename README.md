# BookFlow

This project is a web application that allows users to access various electronic books. You can click on a book you want from the library and read it in EPUB format. You can also add the books you are interested in to the "My Books" section and have the opportunity to read them later. You can easily find suitable books by filtering the books according to their levels. The project also has a translation feature. You can make instant translations on the books you read and save the words you translate. You can also save the sentences you like in the book as notes and access these notes later. In order to do all this, you must first become a member of the site.
